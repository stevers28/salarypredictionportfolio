    "The assignment I received only came with this instruction:\n",

    "I didn't receive any additional background or information about why I'd be asked to do this. Understanding the \"why\" behind any data science project is crucial. If this were a real project, I would ask the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Who are the ultimate end users of this project?\n",
    "- Where does the source data come from?\n",
    "- What are the main issues they are trying to solve?\n",
    "- How are they solving those issues right now?\n",
    "- What are the issue/disadvantages of the current approach?\n",
    "- What are the key components to a successful model?\n",

    "\n",
    "The human resources department has requested this project. They obtained the data about job posting salaries from an independent salary research firm. The research firm claims that the data was collected within the last year from comparable companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HR department would like to ensure that the company offers competitive salaries, not too high or too low. They would like to include a predicted salary as a reference point in their decision of whether or not to approve salaries for job postings.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, they are using rough salary bands provided by the salary reasearch firm as a reference point. However, these are only based on the generic job title (CEO, CFO, Janitor, etc), and the HR department feels that it would be good to include a few other factors to get a more specific salary estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A successful model would be able to predict a salary based on the features provided in the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other items to consider**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make a more accurate model, it would be good to include other features in the data. For example, the specific market that the job is in will likely have a large impact on the salary. Also, there are other components to compensation that may be worth considering as well, such as bonus, vacation days, etc. It would also be good to have more information about things like company size. In my model, I haven't removed any industries, but it would likely be appropriate to focus only on the industry of the target client. \n",
    "\n",
    "While job postings are an interesting data point, it is important to remember that they do not represent the actual salaries ultimately agreed upon. It would be good to consider the cost of acquiring actual salary data which could be used in defining guidelines for appropriate salary bands and salary negotiations."
